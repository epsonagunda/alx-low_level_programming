#Hash function

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values,
Hashing is a computationally and storage space-efficient form of data access that avoids the non-constant access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys.
A hash function may be considered to perform three functions:
Convert variable-length keys into fixed length (usually machine word length or less) values, by folding them by words or other units using a parity-preserving operator like ADD or XOR.
Scramble the bits of the key so that the resulting values are uniformly distributed over the keyspace.
Map the key values into ones less than or equal to the size of the table
